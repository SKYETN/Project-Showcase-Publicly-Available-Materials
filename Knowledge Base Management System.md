title: Knowledge Base Management System
---
1. Product: Knowledge Base Management System
2. Product Category: Normal Website
3. Problems solved: add, delete, check and change knowledge, connect to the graph database to form a knowledge map; add the review cycle; add todo list
4. Scenario: Student A wants to record and manage his knowledge, so he builds a knowledge base management system to do so.
5. how to do: IDE use ideaU, framework springboot, connected to the Ali cloud RDS database and Neo4j graphics database, interface design with Vue, selected page style, development interface test interface, hot deployment, the development of functionality, the development of statistical charts, the development of single sign-on and interceptors. Specifically, the use of idea and mybatis connection Neo4j graphics database and sql database, springboot development interface and from the database to extract the appropriate data packaged as a parameter class, the front-end to get the parameter class and processing.
6. Difficulties: the whole process, I learned the complete web application development process
7. Other gains: learn Ali cloud and other cloud development environment and deployment on the cloud.
8. How do you think it can be modified: add AI assistant, add suggestion module, add chat box with teachers
9. Are there any other extension applications? It can be used as a prototype and development template to directly develop e-book management system, product purchase system, user profile system and so on.
10. Development habit learning: each new feature submitted once, and then you can form a line of development progression. The route of development should be clear, and the structure of the code file arrangement should be clear and simple.
11. Some Debugs: 1. If can't import the maven dependencies, we can import the dependencies one by one. 2. The databases connection may not work if you forgot to switch between multiple databases, or you don't have the table in the database. 3. new example() as well as ctrl alt v and other shortcuts need to be more familiar with the use of, so that the efficiency will be higher. 4. naming rules. 5. after code restart, it must be tested. 6. maven compilation will be delayed, such as can not find the package, open the right side, lifecycle clean double-click on the recompile (clear) . 7. parameter too large need to be encapsulated as class. 8. util needs to be updated regularly.
